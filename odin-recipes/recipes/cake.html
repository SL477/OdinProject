    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple but good cake which you can customise as you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>4 ounces butter</li>
      <li>4 ounces I can't believe it's not butter</li>
      <li>8 ounces sugar</li>
      <li>8 ounces self-raising flour</li>
      <li>
        For the buttercream icing: 4 ounces icing sugar &amp; 2 ounces butter
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the sugar &amp; butter</li>
      <li>Beat in the eggs</li>
      <li>Fold in the flour</li>
      <li>
        Bake at 180Â°c for 20 minutes in greased baking tins. You may then need
        to leave it for a few more minutes. When it is cooked the sponge will
        bounce back when you press on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the buttercream icing boil some water. Then put the icing sugar and
        butter into a bowl. Drop a couple of drops of boiling water into the
        icing mix along with some melted chocolate. Mix the mixture
      </li>
      <li>
        After the cake has cooled put the icing in between the two halves of
        cake. Coat with melted chocolate and decorate as required.
